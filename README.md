# block_everything_invidious
Firefox addon that blocks manipulative elements on Invidious instances


Originally forked from mverleg's "Block Comments"

This addon blocks anything which is primarily, rather than *content*, something to influence the way we *feel* about what we're seeing. It blocks: ratings, view counts, subscriber counts, and homepage recommendations

Realistically, it's just the way that **I** *personally* prefer to browse.

**To install:** 

*From this repo:*
Compress these files into a .zip folder (with manifest.json at the **root** of the .zip folder), go to *about:addons* in *Firefox Developer Edition* or *Firefox ESR* and click *"Install addon from file"*, and select the .zip folder
